Canonical semantic vocabulary, product characteristics and assisted classification for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

* The developer's Plugin URI provides the official plugin information (read-only for shop administrators). Its public excerpt appears to the left of the locally bundled version history, both centered in the three-zone admin header.



TaxoCommerce Vocabulary helps site administrators maintain canonical labels, technical attributes and assignments to WooCommerce content.

* Uses canonical existing vocabulary, role-mapping and technical attribute storage on migrating installations.
* Provides a classifier with proposals based on product titles, descriptions, WooCommerce tags, brands, categories, SKU and optional supplier metadata; classification is not applied automatically.
* Recovers controlled term aliases and technical unit extraction from the original classifier, with reviewable source evidence, without a monolith dependency.
* Supports CSV management of semantic and attribute masters and portable JSON import/export of assignments.
* Mandatory import simulation and MERGE/MIRROR modes make bulk updates reviewable.
* Numeric source IDs are audit-only: portable references are resolved against the target site's real objects.
* Integrated Auto Test: 16 read-only and explicitly skipped checks, two results per user for 30 days, and comparison between runs.
* In-plugin Manual: separate user and technical guides for screens, data model, security, and migration risks.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate TaxoCommerce Vocabulary alongside WooCommerce.
2. Check existing masters and assignments before changing anything.
3. Export a backup before running an import.
4. Simulate JSON imports, review unresolved objects and then approve intentional changes.

== Changelog ==

= 0.3.17 =
* Three-zone responsive admin header, centered official developer information and own Markdown history; remove shop administrator URL configuration. Issue #2476.

= 0.3.13 =
* Added an optional, collapsed version history beneath the admin header title, reading only this plugin's bundled CHANGELOG.md. No new admin tab, Core dependency, data changes or external requests.


= 0.3.10 =
* Extend the existing simulated MERGE/MIRROR portable JSON flow to WordPress posts and pages, including SEO landings represented as pages. Resolve by portable slug/path rather than source IDs; keep current product/category import contracts.

= 0.3.9 =
* Restore independent semantic extraction from product content, tags, brand and SKU, including technical units and controlled aliases. Preserve reviewable proposals and JSON; no automatic product changes.


= 0.3.8 =
* Nombre uniforme «Autocheck» y exportación JSON autenticada de los resultados con detalle por prueba.

= 0.3.7 =
* Cabecera administrativa uniforme de TaxoCommerce con nombre, icono y versión visible.
* Compatible sin Core; controles, pestañas y permisos intactos.


= 0.3.6 =
* Validate uploaded portable JSON metadata and repeat nonce verification at input readers.
* Document bounded taxonomy queries and scoped read-only admin URL nonce exceptions.
* Document narrowly scoped PHPCS exceptions for live custom-table queries without cross-plugin cache invalidation; keep all real SQL identifier preparation checks enabled.

= 0.3.5 =
* Prepare canonical vocabulary SQL identifiers with WordPress %i placeholders across admin, classifier, CSV and portable JSON import/export.
* Validate uploaded CSV metadata and sanitize classifier filters before use.
* Keep existing manual, Auto Test, data model and CSV/JSON behaviour; exclude tests and FTP metadata from the release ZIP.


= 0.3.4 =
* Add Auto Test tab: runtime, hooks, WooCommerce, MySQL, all nine canonical tables, bounded reads, classifier, portable interface and manual; destructive operations explicitly skipped.
* Keep two per-user self-test reports for 30 days with version, results and regression comparison.
* Add in-plugin user and technical manuals, preserving the five existing tabs and CSV/JSON behaviour.
* Add PHP 7.4/8.4 regression test and ensure development tests are excluded from release ZIP.


= 0.3.3 =
* Replace direct PHP filesystem access in CSV import/export with WordPress-compatible handling.
* Render import forms directly with escaped values instead of concatenating raw form markup.

= 0.3.2 =
* Portable semantic backups, object identity resolution and import simulation.
* MERGE/MIRROR assignment controls and fingerprinted exports.

= 0.3.0 =
* Canonical storage reuse, independent classifier and CSV master exchange.

== Historical origins (monolith; not standalone releases) ==
* [Complete legacy and release history](https://github.com/distribuidordeherramientases-wq/seo-taxonomy/tree/main/taxocommerce-vocabulary) (changelog.txt / CHANGELOG.md).

* Legacy origin: the monolith 2.2.1–2.2.8 cycles implemented the Vocabulary bridge, canonical product tags, semantic label editing and mapping between terms and catalogue records.
* The old SEO relationships and vocabulary tables were an input to taxonomy, category mapping, catalogue search and Dependiente semantic interpretation.
* Monolith 2.3.x evolved semantic classification and evidence-based relationships; vocabulary data had to remain stable while the plugins were separated.
* Standalone Vocabulary 0.3.x centralised semantic labels and catalogue relation administration with controlled import/export and integrity checks.
* Later standalone fixes tightened CSV upload limits and SQL identifier preparation, and resolved WordPress.org Plugin Check issues without inventing or recreating the historical taxonomy data.
* Vocabulary, Core and Assistant retain separate responsibilities: semantic terms, shared family administration and learning/search respectively.

== External Services ==

Optional: if an administrator enters an HTTPS URL to an official WordPress page, the plugin requests that site's public `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages` endpoint with the page slug to read only its published excerpt and link. No visitor identity or credentials are submitted. A 12-hour cache (15 minutes after failure) avoids repeated requests. The administrator chooses and should review the source site's privacy policy and terms. No provider is configured by default.

== Official excerpt ==

The optional admin information panel defaults to this plugin's `Plugin URI`, a public project page. Only its published excerpt is retrieved via safe WordPress REST HTTPS and cached locally. Administrators may override or explicitly clear the URL to disable requests. No network dependency for core functionality.
