CSV-only supplier catalogue management for the TaxoCommerce family.

== Description ==

* The developer's Plugin URI is the only official source; the public REST excerpt is cached and its last verified value survives connection failures. On a first-install offline shop, the plugin author's bundled Description is displayed until connectivity returns. The client cannot edit the official URL. History remains local and separate.



TaxoCommerce Suppliers owns the supplier intake and intermediate supplier catalogue workflow.

Included:
* CSV-only supplier imports.
* Reusable CSV mapping templates.
* Generic canonical CSV import format and price-only update format; no provider templates preinstalled.
* Compatibility with existing regional CSV feed parsing without preloading third-party supplier presets.
* Intermediate inventory with pending, review, accepted, and discarded decisions.
* WooCommerce product linking/creation on acceptance.
* Supplier price correction and optional WooCommerce price updates.
* External supplier image references stored without downloading to Media.
* Purchasing view that matches active WooCommerce sales to accepted supplier sources.
* Compatibility with the existing seo_proveedores_productos and seo_supplier_images tables.
* Public service taxocommerce_suppliers_get_sources() for purchasing and other family plugins.
* Full end-user Manual and technical developer reference with separate headings, indexed sections, operating tables, contracts and regression checklist in the Manual tab.
* Read-only, manually triggered Autotest of services, administration hooks, WooCommerce, settings and schema.

Explicitly excluded:
* Scraping.
* Crawlers.
* GitHub Actions runners.
* Cloud Run jobs.
* Automatic supplier website extraction.

== Changelog ==

= 0.2.16 =

== Historical origins (monolith; not standalone releases) ==
* [Complete legacy and release history](https://github.com/distribuidordeherramientases-wq/seo-taxonomy/tree/main/taxocommerce-suppliers) (changelog.txt / CHANGELOG.md).

* Legacy origin: supplier catalogue recipes, CSV feeds, stock/availability imports and commercial supplier relations were maintained in TaxoCommerce SEO; legacy 2.2.x–2.4.1 are not Suppliers standalone versions.
* The monolith 2.2.0 cycle documented Supplier Import / Sync V2; 2.3.5–2.3.9 introduced successive supplier/inventory and catalogue import improvements.
* The original catalogue workflow used supplier data and an intermediate product inventory before WooCommerce publication, with availability and images kept attributable to their suppliers.
* Standalone Suppliers 0.1.0 established CSV-based supplier catalogue handling and integration with the family of modular plugins.
* Standalone 0.2.0 moved purchasing functions out of Logistics and into Suppliers, separating procurement from delivery and transport calculation.

== External Services ==

Optional: if an administrator enters an HTTPS URL to an official WordPress page, the plugin requests that site's public `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages` endpoint with the page slug to read only its published excerpt and link. No visitor identity or credentials are submitted. A 12-hour cache (15 minutes after failure) avoids repeated requests. The administrator chooses and should review the source site's privacy policy and terms. No provider is configured by default.

== Official excerpt ==

The optional admin information panel defaults to this plugin's `Plugin URI`, a public project page. Only its published excerpt is retrieved via safe WordPress REST HTTPS and cached locally. Administrators may override or explicitly clear the URL to disable requests. No network dependency for core functionality.
