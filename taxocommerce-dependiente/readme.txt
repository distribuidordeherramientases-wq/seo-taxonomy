An auditable catalog assistant for WooCommerce, with independent learning, semantic interpretation and customer-facing product search.

== Description ==

* Optional official WordPress page excerpt in a collapsed header panel (left of the local version history), fetched through a safe HTTPS REST request only after its URL is configured by an administrator; cached and never required to run the plugin.


Auto Test: 51 independent read-only checks grouped by runtime, schema, L1-L10 sources/quality, M11, search/feedback, M12 and backup. Reports are per-user transients; no new tables or background jobs. Expensive or destructive UAT remains explicitly unexecuted.

TaxoCommerce Assistant builds searchable product knowledge from the site's WooCommerce catalog and available editorial content.

* L1-L10: bounded, auditable learning steps with source snapshots and quality checks.
* M11: semantic interpretation and relevance evaluation; uncertain matches can ask for clarification.
* M12: incremental updates when products or related content change.
* Search shortcode: [taxocommerce_dependiente_moderno].
* Independent administration of learning progress, quality reports, knowledge transfers and local backups.
* Built-in User Guide with user and technical manuals, with no learning or settings writes.
* Uses its own tables for snapshots, learning, semantic rules and feedback.
* Keeps the legacy public shortcode untouched when the former plugin is active in production.

Learning does not edit the source products. The plugin runs local background tasks and needs WordPress cron to process queued learning.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate WooCommerce.
2. Install and activate TaxoCommerce Assistant from its standalone ZIP.
3. Open its administration page to inspect learning progress. On a genuinely new installation with published local WooCommerce products, the plugin schedules its bounded L1-L10 training automatically. With no published products it stays idle; Start remains available at any time.
4. Add [taxocommerce_dependiente_moderno] to a page to test the new storefront search.
5. Confirm relevance and resource usage before replacing an existing storefront search.

TaxoCommerce Core is optional for central menu integration.

== Privacy ==

Product and editorial information is processed in the WordPress database. The assistant can store search queries, clicks and clarifications as feedback events to improve aggregate relevance. According to its current data contract, these records exclude visitor IP addresses, names and email addresses. Site administrators should disclose this processing in their privacy notice, evaluate their lawful basis and data retention, and test the frontend before enabling it for visitors.

The plugin does not need an external AI inference service for its default local catalog learning workflow.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it replace my existing public search automatically? =

No. Use [taxocommerce_dependiente_moderno] explicitly. Existing shortcodes remain under the original plugin during the migration.

= Does learning modify WooCommerce product descriptions or prices? =

No. Learning builds and evaluates separate knowledge records.

= Does it require TaxoCommerce Core? =

No. Core provides optional grouped administration.

== Clean installation and local learning ==

A new installation creates the Assistant's learning/lexicon/evidence schemas empty; it does NOT insert example tools, synonyms or knowledge from the developer's store. Only technical configuration, lesson definitions and generic language processing rules are bundled. On a first installation only, if the site's WooCommerce catalogue contains at least one published product, the plugin schedules its bounded L1-L10 learning through WordPress cron; training is not run synchronously during activation. If there are no published products, it stays idle until the administrator starts learning. Reactivation or updates never restart training automatically. After catalog learning, the Interpreter/Linguist builds evidence-backed lexical relationships from local products and taxonomy. Plugin upgrades do not erase existing learning. No sample dataset is installed automatically.

== Changelog ==

= 0.3.36 =
* Additional translated administration controls and diagnostics ES/EN/FR/DE/NL with five rebuilt MO catalogs and regression smoke test; preserves official excerpt feature.


= 0.3.32 =
* Added an optional, collapsed version history beneath the admin header title, reading only this plugin's bundled CHANGELOG.md. No new admin tab, Core dependency, data changes or external requests.


= 0.3.30 =
* M11: búsquedas lingüísticas indexadas, progreso persistente por expresión y recuperación controlada ante interrupciones repetidas; preserva L1-L10 y M12. Diagnósticos de duración e identificador del caso y prueba con 33.409 expresiones.

= 0.3.28 =
* Record and skip empty lesson snapshots without inventing learning outcomes or quality scores.
* Allow L1 hierarchy learning in product-free shops; later empty product/Vocabulary lessons do not stop the curriculum.
* Recover stalled WP-Cron from the authorized Academy admin page using a four-tick and two-second budget, while preserving owner locks.

= 0.3.27 =
* Prevent manual Start or Restart in an empty WooCommerce catalog without deleting any learning data.
* Explain and stop a newly started background training job with no products instead of leaving it marked as running.
* Refresh Academy progress during source-snapshot and learning phases, not only quality exams.
* Keep existing frozen snapshots and existing customer knowledge intact.


= 0.3.26 =
* After creating empty knowledge tables on a genuine first install, schedule bounded learning from published products of this site's WooCommerce catalogue; never read a shipped developer dataset.
* Leave empty shops idle. Never auto-start on upgrades/reactivation, when pre-existing knowledge exists or when schema reads fail.
* Preserve all existing manual learning controls, pause/stop, quality gates and scheduled worker; no synchronous full catalogue scan in plugin activation.
* Add isolated first-install discovery and scheduling smoke test.

= 0.3.25 =
* Stop installing the 17 hardcoded tool expressions into the customer lexicon. Fresh tables are empty, while existing learned data and evidence remain untouched.
* Retain catalog-driven learning, manual start, language grammar and schema upgrade behavior. Add isolated installation/upgrade regression smoke test and CI coverage.


= 0.3.24 =
* Unifica «Autocheck» y permite descargar JSON autenticado de los resultados de la última ejecución, sin modificar servicios ni contenidos.

= 0.3.23 =
* Cabecera administrativa unificada de TaxoCommerce con nombre, icono y versión.
* Estilos propios sin Core, funciones y permisos intactos.


= 0.3.22 =
* Allow administrators to set an independent Top-8 quality threshold for each L1-L10 lesson (0–100%), preserving previous defaults.
* Provide explicit, audited acceptance of an existing failed lesson once its actual result meets the new chosen threshold.
* Preserve exam scores, failed examples and source content while advancing without retraining completed lessons.


= 0.3.21 =
* Replace the dynamic L8/L10 UNION review query with a fixed, fully prepared SQL statement; preserve per-lesson sample caps and pagination.
* The packaged plugin passed strict Plugin Check with zero errors and zero warnings after this change.

= 0.3.20 =
* Document the safety of prepared L8/L10 review SQL and the atomic, owner-checked release of learning worker locks.
* Retain learning state and concurrency safety while addressing strict Plugin Check findings.

= 0.3.19 =
* Keep CI test scripts and hidden FTP state outside WordPress.org release packages.
* Validate learning priority input and safely quote internal learning table identifiers.


= 0.3.18 =
* Add a responsive User Guide tab with separate User Manual and Technical Manual inside Dependiente.
* Explain learning, quality recovery, Interpreter M11, M12, search and feedback, backups, plugin architecture and data contracts.
* Preserve all training controls, imports, exports, cron and frontend behavior.



* Auto Test reports functional readiness separately from educational outcomes and historical process errors. M11, learning and M12 remain green when endpoints, workers and state contracts are available, with diagnostic detail.
* A bounded search that returns no candidates is marked as inconclusive instead of reporting a broken search engine solely from its result set.
* No training, feedback, content or backup mutations are performed by Auto Test.


= 0.3.17 =
* Add 51 non-destructive Auto Test checks in ten groups, covering runtime, schema, learning sources, quality, interpreter, search, feedback, M12 and backup.

= 0.3.16 =
* Port the original Interpreter 1.2.0 runtime and full Linguist course into the independent Assistant while preserving legacy functionality and training state.

= 0.3.15 =
* Raised the adaptive maximum-speed learning ceiling from 79 to 600 items per chunk, starting from 47 and growing only when duration and memory allow it.
* Avoid reducing a fast worker simply because its own PHP process has high CPU utilisation: it is not the hosting account CPU.
* The manager can execute up to four bounded learning ticks per callback on maximum speed, subject to its runtime budget, stop flag and locks.
* The previous learning snapshots, results, cursor and quality gates remain unchanged.


= 0.3.14 =
* M11 validates 180 distributed L9 queries with the current family/product evaluator instead of 100 obsolete stored queries.
* Resume M11 regression in CPU-limited batches without restarting any of the ten lessons.
* Add M11 audit JSON, progress counters, failure evidence, revision and version tracking.


= 0.3.13 =
* Record evaluator revision, actual PHP plugin version and L9 query provenance in quality JSON reports.
* Flag old L9/L10 audit results as stale and allow repeat of only the current quality examination.
* Preserve existing L1-L9 snapshots and the 90% quality gate for L10.


= 0.3.12 =
* Rebuild L9 evaluation needs deterministically from sealed learned facts, instead of reusing historical legacy questions.
* Treat non-unique colour/material hints as family requests; retain exact-product requests for model/measure/capacity.
* Fix generic repair-token ranking bias; include per-result evidence and per-run query provenance in L9 audit.
* Re-evaluation does not clear L1-L8 memory or change source catalog content.


= 0.3.11 =

* Make FAQ schema compatibility queries explicit and fully prepared.
* Remove dynamic SQL condition fragments from semantic and identity lookups.
* Harden streamed knowledge export output for WordPress Plugin Check.

= 0.3.8 =
* L6 reads both current and historical `seo_faq` schemas during migration.
* Falls back to `0 AS product_cat_id` when the legacy FAQ table has not yet been upgraded.
* Reports SQL read failures explicitly instead of misreporting them as an empty training source.

= 0.3.7 =
* Standalone auditable L1-L10 learning and M11/M12 semantic search.
* Knowledge transfer and local backup interfaces.
* Explicit shortcode for parallel testing.

= 0.3.6 =
* Extend structured learning audit reports and correction queues consistently across lessons L1–L10.

= 0.3.0 =
* Launch the independent learning architecture with L1–L10 snapshots, M11 Interpreter and M12 continuous update.

== Historical origins (monolith; not standalone releases) ==
* [Complete legacy and release history](https://github.com/distribuidordeherramientases-wq/seo-taxonomy/tree/main/taxocommerce-dependiente) (changelog.txt / CHANGELOG.md).

* Legacy origin: the customer-facing Dependiente, Academia, semantic interpreter and learning engine ran in TaxoCommerce SEO before the independent Assistant plugin; the monolith 2.2.x–2.4.1 numbers are not Assistant versions.
* The 2.3.5–2.3.9 monolith cycles documented course progression, supervised product/category feedback, training diagnostics, semantic matching and customer-facing search.
* The monolith also contained the Intérprete/Lingüista learning material; migration into the standalone Assistant retained the lessons, evidence, data contracts, evaluation and compatibility with WooCommerce product search.
* Independent training supports L1–L10 snapshots, quality gates and audit exports; M11 interpreter evaluation and M12 continuous update were evolved as separately monitored functions.
* Specific later fixes addressed stale quality exams, L9 ranking bias, batch worker speed, runtime availability checks, and safe prepared SQL for WordPress.org, without discarding learned data.
* The administrator-configurable quality thresholds introduced in 0.3.22 allow an audited acceptance decision; they do not change the actual underlying scores or repair poor source data.

== External Services ==

Optional: if an administrator enters an HTTPS URL to an official WordPress page, the plugin requests that site's public `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages` endpoint with the page slug to read only its published excerpt and link. No visitor identity or credentials are submitted. A 12-hour cache (15 minutes after failure) avoids repeated requests. The administrator chooses and should review the source site's privacy policy and terms. No provider is configured by default.

== Official excerpt ==

The optional admin information panel defaults to this plugin's `Plugin URI`, a public project page. Only its published excerpt is retrieved via safe WordPress REST HTTPS and cached locally. Administrators may override or explicitly clear the URL to disable requests. No network dependency for core functionality.
