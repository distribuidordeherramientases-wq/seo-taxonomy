A private task agenda with categories, priorities, assignments, calendar and indicators. Independent of WooCommerce.

== Description ==

* Optional official WordPress page excerpt in a collapsed header panel (left of the local version history), fetched through a safe HTTPS REST request only after its URL is configured by an administrator; cached and never required to run the plugin.


TaxoCommerce Tasks provides a standalone task management area in the WordPress administrator. Its administration uses the same self-contained header as the TaxoCommerce family, displaying the plugin title, installed version and publication date without requiring Core. A collapsed version history is available directly beneath the header title.

* Create, edit and delete tasks and private task categories.
* Prioritize tasks as Low, Normal, High or Urgent.
* Track pending, in-progress, blocked and completed tasks.
* Assign tasks to registered WordPress users; control access with manage_options.
* Filter and sort tasks by status, priority, category, assignee and due date.
* Navigate a monthly duration calendar with priority-colored bars from task start through due date, collision-free overlap lanes, and cross-month continuations.
* Monitor dashboard indicators for overdue tasks, states, priorities and assignees.
* Run a private, read-only Autocheck and download its JSON report.
* Rename existing task categories safely without changing their IDs or task assignments.
* Read a built-in User Manual and Technical Manual (Spanish, English, French, German and Dutch) from separate admin tabs.

Tasks and task categories live exclusively in two custom database tables using the site's WordPress prefix. No WordPress posts, pages, WooCommerce products or public endpoints are created. No external services or data transfers are used. This plugin does not require WooCommerce, TaxoCommerce Core or any other TaxoCommerce plugin.

Administrative labels and both manuals use native WordPress gettext with bundled POT/PO/MO files in Spanish, English, French, German and Dutch; WordPress language packs take precedence. Task titles, descriptions and category names are entered by administrators and are not automatically translated.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `taxocommerce-tasks` directory into `wp-content/plugins`, or install the ZIP in WordPress.
2. Activate TaxoCommerce Tasks. Two private SQL tables are created with the site's own table prefix.
3. Open Tasks in the WordPress administrator and add categories and tasks.
4. Use Calendar, Dashboard and Autocheck tabs for planning and validation.
5. Open User Manual and Technical Manual in the same screen to consult the instructions and architecture.

Only users with the `manage_options` capability can view or modify the agenda. Uninstalling the plugin does not delete task records.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it publish tasks on my website? =

No. Tasks are not registered as post types and no public REST, shortcode or frontend view exists.

= Does it share categories with WooCommerce? =

No. Categories are private to this plugin and are held in a dedicated SQL table.

= Does it depend on TaxoCommerce Core? =

No. It is standalone.

When TaxoCommerce Core is active, Tasks appears within its administration submenu and its Extensions overview. Without Core, Tasks provides its own standalone administration menu. The private task tables and page slug remain unchanged.

== External Services ==

Optional: if an administrator enters an HTTPS URL to an official WordPress page, the plugin requests that site's public `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages` endpoint with the page slug to read only its published excerpt and link. No visitor identity or credentials are submitted. A 12-hour cache (15 minutes after failure) avoids repeated requests. The administrator chooses and should review the source site's privacy policy and terms. No provider is configured by default.

== Official excerpt ==

The optional admin information panel defaults to this plugin's `Plugin URI`, a public project page. Only its published excerpt is retrieved via safe WordPress REST HTTPS and cached locally. Administrators may override or explicitly clear the URL to disable requests. No network dependency for core functionality.
