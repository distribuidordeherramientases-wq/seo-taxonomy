Manage WooCommerce catalog structure and WordPress content from a modular dashboard with optional independent extensions.

== Description ==

TaxoCommerce Core provides a modular foundation for WordPress and WooCommerce catalog and content management. WordPress posts, pages, terms and WooCommerce products remain the canonical data sources; Core does not duplicate them into a separate content store.

* Editorial management for products, product categories, posts and pages using native WordPress editing.
* Cached read-only inventory dashboard for products, posts, pages, categories, media, statuses and optional FAQs.
* SEO architecture based on clusters, primary hubs, secondary hubs, product categories and products.
* Native WordPress navigation menu generation with optional manual entries and safe regeneration. SEO menu countries come only from explicitly assigned page countries; Global denotes no country, with no preset menu countries.
* Unified WordPress menu manager: the same two-column loading, publication, object picker and hierarchical structure UI works in classic and block themes. Classic menus retain native WordPress nav_menu storage; block themes use wp_navigation posts. In block themes, add pages, posts, categories, product categories and custom links; rename and edit links, remove safe leaf links, delete an unreferenced navigation only after confirmation, and explicitly activate a header template part when unambiguous. Theme files are never changed; unsupported advanced navigation blocks still use the Site Editor.
* Optional SEO hierarchy menus are only proposed for populated hierarchies. No stored menu is overwritten by viewing the manager. Inline template navigation remains editable in the native Site Editor.
* Architecture reporting with unique counts, explicit manual refresh and local 15-minute caching.
* Read-only editorial guidance for products, categories, posts and pages based on useful content and product identity.
* Process and extension registries with bounded technical logs for independent modules.
* The Core Extensions catalog lists all 19 current independent TaxoCommerce modules even when absent or inactive, including Tasks; each card reports its actual WordPress installation and activation status. Retired Connections is incorporated in Insights and is not offered separately.
* Optional extension discovery for the other TaxoCommerce modules.
* Built-in, read-only User Guide tab containing a user manual and a technical manual for Core.
* Read-only Autocheck with authenticated JSON download of the last user-specific report, including site URL, Core version, pass/fail/skipped results and detailed messages for independent comparison between installations.

Editorial guidance does not create or modify content automatically. Only authorised administrators can upload an optional extension ZIP through Core.

== Languages ==

TaxoCommerce Core uses the WordPress gettext domain `taxocommerce-core` and the plugin `/languages` directory. The WordPress administration locale determines the language automatically. Bundled gettext catalogs cover Spanish (Spain), English (US), French, German and Dutch, with full coverage of the strings currently extracted in each gettext template; technical names and catalog content remain unchanged. The untranslated PHP/JavaScript surface and locale-specific administration display still require functional verification. WordPress.org language packs will be supported once translations are approved.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate TaxoCommerce Core on WordPress 6.5 or newer.
2. Open the Core dashboard to configure content and SEO architecture.
3. If using WooCommerce, inspect product and category information before importing data.
4. Install any optional TaxoCommerce extensions separately and review their dependencies.
5. During migration, verify unique module ownership and avoid simultaneous writes by the original SEO plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Core need the original TaxoCommerce SEO plugin? =

No. Core operates independently; integrations with other modules are optional.

= Does Core automatically rewrite my product descriptions? =

No. Editors and guidance preserve manual author control.

= Does Core support optional extension installation? =

Yes. Administrators may explicitly upload a verified module ZIP through Core's extension panel. Native WordPress installation APIs install the package after temporary validation.

== Historical origins (monolith; not standalone releases) ==
* [Complete legacy and release history](https://github.com/distribuidordeherramientases-wq/seo-taxonomy/tree/main/taxocommerce-core) (changelog.txt / CHANGELOG.md).

* Historical source: the TaxoCommerce SEO monolith through 2.4.1 maintained the SEO architecture, category/product relationships, taxonomy and the original WordPress administration; these are not Core standalone versions.
* The 2.2.x legacy work included the vocabulary bridge, canonical semantic labels and the product/category relationship model.
* During 2.3.x the monolith organised clusters, primary and secondary hubs, landing pages, menus and associated WooCommerce categories/products.
* Core became the administrative and integration point for independent TaxoCommerce extensions, preserving the existing data contracts rather than migrating every service into Core.
* Later standalone work refined the Extensions panel, nested menu navigation, WordPress.org compliance and internal Auto Test. Individual learning, images and feeds remain owned by their respective modules.
* The international storefront uses explicit country-based pages, templates and navigation; the Core layer retains role/menu selection while Templates owns frontend rendering.
