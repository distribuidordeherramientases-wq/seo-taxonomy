Manage WooCommerce catalog structure and WordPress content from a modular dashboard with optional independent extensions.

== Description ==

* Hides only the Action Scheduler overdue-actions admin notice. Scheduled actions and other notices remain unchanged.



TaxoCommerce Core provides a modular foundation for WordPress and WooCommerce catalog and content management. WordPress posts, pages, terms and WooCommerce products remain the canonical data sources; Core does not duplicate them into a separate content store.

* Editorial management for products, product categories, posts and pages using native WordPress editing.
* Cached read-only inventory dashboard for products, posts, pages, categories, media, statuses and optional FAQs.
* SEO architecture based on clusters, primary hubs, secondary hubs, product categories and products.
* Native WordPress navigation menu generation with optional manual entries and safe regeneration. SEO menu countries come only from explicitly assigned page countries; Global denotes no country, with no preset menu countries.
* Unified WordPress menu manager: the same two-column loading, publication, object picker and hierarchical structure UI works in classic and block themes. Classic menus retain native WordPress nav_menu storage; block themes use wp_navigation posts. In block themes, add pages, posts, categories, product categories and custom links; rename and edit links, remove safe leaf links, delete an unreferenced navigation only after confirmation, and explicitly activate a header template part when unambiguous. Theme files are never changed; unsupported advanced navigation blocks still use the Site Editor.
* Optional SEO hierarchy menus are only proposed for populated hierarchies. No stored menu is overwritten by viewing the manager. Inline template navigation remains editable in the native Site Editor.
* Architecture reporting with unique counts, explicit manual refresh and local 15-minute caching.
* Read-only editorial guidance for products, categories, posts and pages based on useful content and product identity.
* Process and extension registries with bounded technical logs for independent modules.
* The Core Extensions catalog lists all 19 current independent TaxoCommerce modules even when absent or inactive, including Tasks; each card reports its actual WordPress installation and activation status. Retired Connections is incorporated in Insights and is not offered separately.
* Optional extension discovery for the other TaxoCommerce modules.
* Built-in, read-only User Guide tab containing a user manual and a technical manual for Core.
* Complete read-only JSON download from Core > Content > Anomalies, including all structural, editorial, category, hub and optional FAQ finding sections from the live report. The existing editorial-only JSON remains separate.
* Autonomous native Code Check: bounded PHP syntax, WordPress structure, source-level security and manual WordPress.org review signals (nonces, capabilities, uploads, lifecycle, buffers, inline CSS, prefixes, sessions and SQL). Includes source location and JSON export; does not run or require the official Plugin Check. Findings remain review warnings, not a certification.
* Read-only Autocheck with authenticated JSON download of the last user-specific report, including site URL, Core version, pass/fail/skipped results and detailed messages for independent comparison between installations.

Editorial guidance does not create or modify content automatically. Only authorised administrators can upload an optional extension ZIP through Core.

== Languages ==

TaxoCommerce Core uses the WordPress gettext domain `taxocommerce-core-catalog-content-management-for-woocommerce` and the plugin `/languages` directory. The WordPress administration locale determines the language automatically. Bundled gettext catalogs cover Spanish (Spain), English (US), French, German and Dutch, with full coverage of the strings currently extracted in each gettext template; technical names and catalog content remain unchanged. The untranslated PHP/JavaScript surface and locale-specific administration display still require functional verification. WordPress.org language packs will be supported once translations are approved.

== Local developer information ==

The administration panel reads Core's bundled `Description` and `Plugin URI` fields without contacting the developer's website or storing remote excerpts. Legacy developer-excerpt cache entries from older versions are removed on uninstall. The plugin's normal functions and other external integrations are unaffected.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate TaxoCommerce Core on WordPress 6.5 or newer.
2. Open the Core dashboard to configure content and SEO architecture.
3. If using WooCommerce, inspect product and category information before importing data.
4. Install any optional TaxoCommerce extensions separately and review their dependencies.
5. During migration, verify unique module ownership and avoid simultaneous writes by the original SEO plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Core need the original TaxoCommerce SEO plugin? =

No. Core operates independently; integrations with other modules are optional.

= Does Core automatically rewrite my product descriptions? =

No. Editors and guidance preserve manual author control.

= Does Core support optional extension installation? =

Yes. Administrators may explicitly upload a verified module ZIP through Core's extension panel. Native WordPress installation APIs install the package after temporary validation.

== Earlier releases ==
